    "\n",
    "1.   **Readability** - whatever model we use, the chats it creates should be easily understood by humans\n",
    "2.   **Consistency** - when chatting with a chatbot, the bot should maintain consistent information. Imagine a bot that says \"Hi I'm Jack'' and then \"Hello, my name is Jane\" - quite confusing\n",
    "3.    **Engaging** - To encourage users to talk to the bot, the bot should be able to generate interesting, engaging responses. If the only response was \"wow, that's cool,\" users are quite unlikely to want to talk very much to the chat bot\n",

Try to use these reasons to guide why you might want to try other models. Complex is not necessarily better. \n",

    "*   Dialog using knowledge: One challenge of these chit chat systems is they do not concretely know any facts. So if you want to chat about a specific topic, the models cannot produce any relevant information - they say generic utterances or incorrect facts. One way to remedy this is to incorporate **knowledge** into the dialogue agents. This has been investigated in many different ways, but one of the first papers to show this is https://arxiv.org/abs/1811.01241. In this work, data is collected by asking one speaker to reference Wikipedia sentences.\n",
